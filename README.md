-----------------------

###Pre-work:
------------
The following workshop is a requirement to be completed prior to starting the iOS 401 course. If you have attended the workshop in person, this will count as completing the workshop. If not, you may work through it individually prior to your course start date:  

**[Swift 3 Workshop](https://github.com/codefellows/swift-3-workshop)**

#### 1. Code 401
If you are completely new to coding, this course will be very challenging. Our instructors would like to recommend our students to consider [Code 301](https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-301/intermediate-software-development) as a prerequisite for the 401.

#### 2. Ensure your laptop is up to the task of coding

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

#### 3. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

  - [Mac OS X](os-setup.md): Currently, a Mac is **REQUIRED** to be able to take the iOS 401 Course.

Following completion of these Pre-work assignments, you should:
 - Have a terminal with a Git compatible prompt
 - Be able to receive a valid response when typing "git --version"

#### 4. Download and Install Xcode from the AppStore
 - [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12) - Primary tool for development of iOS and OSX Applications. 

#### 5. Download and Install Slack

We use Slack to distribute files and collaborate before, during, and after the workshop.
