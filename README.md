401: iOS Development with Swift and Objective-C
-----------------------

###Pre-work:
------------

#### 1. Code 401
If you are completely new to coding, this course will be very challenging. Our instructors would like to recommend our students to consider [Code 301](https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-301/intermediate-software-development) as a prerequisite for the 401.

#### 2. Ensure your laptop is up to the task of coding

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

#### 3. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

  - [Mac OS X](os-setup.md): Currently, a Mac is **REQUIRED** to be able to take the iOS 401 Course.

Following completion of these Pre-work assignments, you should:
 - Have a terminal with a Git compatible prompt
 - Be able to receive a valid response when typing "git --version"

#### 4. Download and Install Xcode from the AppStore
 - [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12) - Primary tool for development of iOS and OSX Applications. 

#### 5. Download and Install Slack

We use Slack to distribute files and collaborate before, during, and after the workshop.

  - [Download Slack](https://slack.com/apps)

Look for an email from us prior to the workshop, in order to join our Slack team.
